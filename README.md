#Reflow Cleaner

This extension hopes to clean the HTML that Adobe Edge Reflow makes in order to provide a better starting spot for hand coded projects.

## Abilities 
Currently the project does the following:

1. Converts id's that you mark in Reflow into elements
1. Removes Clearfix classes
1. Removes textspan id's

## Future
I'd also like to parse the CSS file and grab all of the media queries breakpoints, fonts and colors, so you have a place to refer to when trying to style the handcoded stuff.
